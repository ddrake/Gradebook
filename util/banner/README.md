The script 'banweb_get_students' takes an assignment number and uses [Selenium](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) to navigate Banweb and download an HTML table with all students registered for the course into a temporary text file called 'classlist.html'.  This is necessary because (surprisingly) Banner doesn't provide an API for fetching the current roster.  Selenium can be installed via pip. A valid 'banner_credentials.txt' file must be present in the gradebook folder.  After creating 'classlist.html', The script then calls the script 'roster_parser' to extract a simple, tab-separated list of student names and emails into a file called 'students.txt'.  This file can then be imported into Gradebook.  If the process succeeds without any errors, the temporary 'classlist.html' file is deleted.  Otherwise, it is left for debugging purposes.  The script 'roster_parser' can be run directly against 'classlist.html'.
