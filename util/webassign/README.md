The script 'wa' takes an assignment number and uses [Selenium](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) to navigate Webassign and download a report with all scores for all students for the course into a text file called 'raw_scores.txt'.  This is necessary because (surprisingly) Webassign doesn't provide an API for this purpose.  Selenium can be installed via pip. A valid wa_credentials.txt file must be present in the gradebook folder.  The script then extracts the specified assignment from 'raw_scores.txt' to a file called 'online_scores.txt' which can be imported into Gradebook.  Check the script for details of how individual Webassign assignments can be grouped into weekly assignments for import purposes.

The script wa_scores_from_raw can be used to extract a different assignment from a previously downloaded 'raw_scores.txt' file, overwriting the current 'online_scores.txt' file.
